Priskovel thinks about himself that he is a very good driver. However, his brother, Priskovinko, thinks that Priskovel can't drive economically. They decide to compete in Q days one against each other to see who was the lowest fuel consumption after .

Each day, Priskovel starts by resetting the average consumption and then driving the car X1​​ km with an average fuel consumption of C1​​ litres per 100km. Priskovinko continues the next X2​​ km, without resetting the fuel consumption meter, resulting in a fuel consumption of C2​ (litres per 100km) for the whole trip (for the distance X1+X2​). So, the consumption C2​​ is for both Priskovel and Priskovinko on that day.

Help them find out what consumption (in litres per 100km) had Priskovinko on each day. (On the segment of X2​​ kilometers)

Standard input

The first line contains Q the number of days that they compete.

The next Q lines contain X1, X2, C1, C2​​ separated by spaces.
Standard output

The output contains Q lines. On each line it is the average the fuel consumption C2​​ that Priskovinko had had on the distance X2​​ on that day.
