On an infinite grid, there are two pawns. The first one is located at the cell (X​1​​,Y​1​​), and the second one at the cell (X​2​​,Y​2​​). Each of them wants to reach to the cell (X​3​​,Y​3​​).

In one, move, The first pawn can go only in one of the four adjacent cells,with which his current cell shares a common edge. (i.e. from the cell (X,Y) he can go to one of the following cells: (X±1,Y) or (X,Y±1).

The second pawn can go in one move in 8 cells: In addition to the first pawns, he can go in the adjacent cells on the diagonal. (i.e. he can move from (X,Y) to cells (X+a,Y+b), where −1≤a,b≤1) and aaa and bbb are not simultaneously 0.

Standard input

The first line contains one integer NNN, denoting the number of tests.

On each of the next N lines, there are 6 integers: X1,Y2,X2,Y2,X3,Y3​​ in this order.
Standard output

The output should have NNN lines. The i-th line should have one of the following: "Same time" - if both pawns reach the target cell at the same time, "First" - if the first pawns finishes first, or "Second" if the second one reaches first.
